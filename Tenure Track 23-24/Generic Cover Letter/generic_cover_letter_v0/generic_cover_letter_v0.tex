Dear Committee Members,

I am writing to apply for the [POSITION NEEDED] in the [PLACE NEEDED]. Currently, I am a postdoctoral researcher in the Mathematics Department at Brown University, a position I have held since August 2022. I received my Ph.D. in Mathematics from the University of Wisconsin - Madison in 2020 under the guidance of my advisor Professor Daniel Erman. From 2020-2022 I was an NSF Postdoctoral Fellow in the Mathematics Department at the University of California, Berkeley.

My research interests lie in the intersection of algebraic geometry and commutative algebra. In particular, I am interested in using combinatorial and homological methods to study the geometry of algebraic varieties. Further, I am passionate about promoting inclusivity, diversity, and justice in the mathematics community. This passion extends throughout my teaching where I am dedicated to creating an interactive and supportive classroom environment that helps students thrive. 

With my application, I include the standard AMS cover sheet, a curriculum vitae, a research statement, and a teaching statement. I will have five letters of recommendation. Four research letters: Christine Berkesch (\href{mailto:cberkesc@umn.edu}{cberkesc@umn.edu}), Melody Chan (\href{mailto:melody\_chan@brown.edu}{melody\_chan@brown.edu}), Daniel Erman (\href{mailto:erman@hawaii.edu}{erman@hawaii.edu}), and Gregory G. Smith (\href{mailto:ggsmith@mast.queensu.ca}{ggsmith@mast.queensu.ca}), and one teaching letter from Shirin Malekpour (\href{mailto:shirin.malekpour@wisc.edu}{shirin.malekpour@wisc.edu}).  
%A few highlights in my file are:
%\begin{itemize}
%\item 
%\item Excellence in Mathematical Research Award (2020) - Awarded by the Department of Mathematics at the University of Wisconsin for substantial contributions to research as part of a thesis. 
%\item Capstone Teaching Award (2019) - Awarded by the Department of Mathematics at the University of Wisconsin to 1 student recognizing a record of exceptional teaching and service.
%\item Teaching Assistant Award for Exceptional Service  (2018) - Awarded by the University of Wisconsin to up to 3 teaching assistants campus-wide recognizing their exceptional service.
%\end{itemize}

Please do not hesitate to contact me with any questions, or if there is anything else I can provide, and thank you in advance for your consideration.
