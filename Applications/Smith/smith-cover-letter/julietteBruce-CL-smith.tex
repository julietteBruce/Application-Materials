To the Hiring Committee,

My name is Juliette Bruce, and I am a graduate student at the University of Wisconsin - Madison, working in algebraic geometry, commutative algebra, and arithmetic geometry under the guidance of my advisor Professor Daniel Erman. I expect to receive my Ph.D. in Mathematics from the University of Wisconsin - Madison in the Spring of 2020. I am writing to apply for the tenure track Assistant Professorship at Smith College. I would also be interested in a temporary one year position. 

 As an LGBTQ woman, the I have worked hard to promote diversity, inclusivity, and justice in the mathematical community. In particular, I have had the opportunity to mentor multiple undergraduate women via the Association for Women in Mathematics's mentor network and the University of Wisconsin's Directed Reading Program. I have also been involved with organizing and volunteering with a number of events hosted by \textit{Spectra}, the association of LGBTQ+ mathematicians. Further, I organized the \textit{Graduate Workshop in Commutative Algebra for Women and Mathematicians of Minority Genders} (2019) to help build the community of women and mathematicians of minority genders in and around commutative algebra. 
 
 With this in mind I am extremely drawn to Smith College's mission of providing women a liberal arts education, which prepares them to become global leaders. In particular, I would love to continue my work of promoting diversity, inclusivity, and justice in mathematics at Smith College. In particular, I would be excited to continue leading reading courses and research projects with students at Smith College. Additionally, I would love to continue my work promoting and fighting for LGBTQ+ students.

With my application, I include the standard AMS cover sheet, a curriculum vitae, a research statement, a teaching statement, and a publication list. I will have five letters of recommendation. Four research letters: Christine Berkesch (\href{mailto:cberkesc@umn.edu}{cberkesc@umn.edu}), David Eisenbud (\href{mailto:de@msri.org}{de@msri.org}), Daniel Erman (\href{mailto:derman@math.wisc.edu}{derman@math.wisc.edu}), and Kiran Kedlaya (\href{mailto:kedlaya@ucsb.edu}{kedlaya@ucsd.edu}), and one teaching letter from Shirin Malekpour (\href{mailto:shirin.malekpour@wisc.edu}{shirin.malekpour@wisc.edu}).

%A few highlights in my file are:
%\begin{itemize}
%\item Invited to speak at \textit{CA+} (April 2020), \textit{Foundations of Computing in Mathematics} (June 2020), and \textit{LGBTQ+Math} (July 2020).
%
%\item Elizabeth Hirschfelder Prize (2019) - Awarded by the Department of Mathematics at the University of Wisconsin to an outstanding female student who has demonstrated promise.
%
%\item Co-organizer for three conferences (\textit{M2@UW}, \textit{Geometry \& Arithmetic of Surfaces}, \textit{Graduate Workshop in Commutative Algebra for Women and Mathematicians of Minority Genders}), a AMS special session, and a Spectra panel. 
%
%\item Teaching Assistant Award for Exceptional Service  (2018) - Awarded by the University of Wisconsin to up to 3 teaching assistants campus-wide recognizing their exceptional service.
%\end{itemize}
